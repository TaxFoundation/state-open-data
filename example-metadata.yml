  # This dataset contains brackets, which are probably the trickiest datatype in Tax Foundation
  # datasets. A bracket consists of two columns: an income level where, over that amount, the
  # marginal rate applies; and the rate itself. While marginal rates are often expressed as
  # income ranges, this can automatically be computered by scripts. All that's necessary here
  # is the lower-bound of the range. Output scripts will use the next-highest bracket value
  # found as the upper-bound.
  #
  # Brackets take up two columns, seen here as position 4: incomeGreaterThan and position 5:
  # rate.
  #
  # Where no data is listed for a state, programs should assume that the data is not available.
  # Here, a state with no corporate income tax, rather than having blank data, has a rate and
  # bracket of 0, 0.

dataset_footnotes:
  - note: >
      This is where you write the footnote. It's OK to write notes on multiple lines.
      Different lines of the note will be combined into a single paragraph.
    applies_to: rows
    apllied_at: [11, 23]
    # List the ID numbers of the rows to which this note applies.
    # In this example, ID numbers will repeat for each tax bracket a state has.
    # Don't worry about the repetition of the state's FIPS ID. The note will work fine.
  - note: >
      Here's another note. While less common, we'll apply this to a specific column of data.
    applies_to: columns
    apllied_at: ['incomeGreaterThan', 'rate'] # List the column names to which this note applies.
  - note: >
      In this note, we'll apply it to the entire data table. No need to define `applied_at`,
      since this note isn't limited to a subset of the data.
