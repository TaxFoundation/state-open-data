  # This dataset contains brackets, which are probably the trickiest datatype in Tax Foundation
  # datasets. A bracket consists of two columns: an income level where, over that amount, the
  # marginal rate applies; and the rate itself. While marginal rates are often expressed as
  # income ranges, this can automatically be computers by scripts. All that's necessary here
  # is the lower-bound of the range. Output scripts will use the next-highest bracket value
  # found as the upper-bound.
  #
  # Brackets take up two columns, seen here as position 4: incomeGreaterThan and position 5:
  # rate.

footnotes:
  - note: >
      This is where you write the footnote. It's OK to write notes on multiple lines.
      Different lines of the note will be combined into a single paragraph.
    applies_to: states
    apllied_at: [11, 23] # List the FIPS codes of the states to which this note applies.
  - note: >
      Here's another note. While less common, we'll apply this to a specific column of data.
    applies_to: data
    apllied_at: [4, 5] # List the column numbers of the data to which this note applies.
  - note: >
      In this note, we'll apply it to the entire data table. No need to define `applied_at`,
      since this note isn't limited to a subset of the data.
