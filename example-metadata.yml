  # This dataset contains brackets, which are probably the trickiest datatype in Tax Foundation
  # datasets. A bracket consists of two columns: an income level where, over that amount, the
  # marginal rate applies; and the rate itself. While marginal rates are often expressed as
  # income ranges, this can automatically be computers by scripts. All that's necessary here
  # is the lower-bound of the range. Output scripts will use the next-highest bracket value
  # found as the upper-bound.
  #
  # Brackets take up two columns, seen here as position 4: incomeGreaterThan and position 5:
  # rate.

      If you need to add a footnote to the entire dataset (e.g., defining a term),
      you can do it like this.
  - for_columns:
    - positions: [3]
    - note: >
      If you wanted to add a footnote to a specific column, you would do it like this.
  - for_rows:
    - ids: [1, 3, 25, 36]
    - note: >
      This is an example of a footnote. By using the > character in the line above,
      I can skip to the next line in this text file but the final rendered text
      will be combined into a single line. No need to include extra spaces--that is
      automatically included when the lines are combined.
